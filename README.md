}
```

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Angular 19.2.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.7.2
- **State Management**: RxJS 7.8.0
- **Styling**: SCSS with modular architecture
- **Testing**: Jasmine + Karma

## IP Address Processing

The application uses sophisticated algorithms to process and sort IP addresses properly:

- IP addresses are converted to numerical values for accurate sorting
- Subnet masks are converted to prefix lengths (CIDR notation)
- Validation ensures that IP addresses and subnet masks follow standard formats

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with:

- **Core Module**: Contains essential services and models
  - Network Route Service: Handles API interactions and data processing
  - Route Sort Service: Manages complex sorting logic for IP addresses

- **Shared Module**: Contains reusable components and utilities
  - IP Utilities: Functions for processing IP addresses and subnet masks
  - Pipes: Custom formatting for table data

- **Feature Modules**: Contain specific application features
  - Network Routes Table: Main component for displaying route information
  - Pagination Controls: Component for navigating through pages of routes
